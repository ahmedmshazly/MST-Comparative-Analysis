# Comparative Analysis of Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms

This repository contains a detailed analysis and implementation of two fundamental algorithms in graph theory: Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms. The focus is on their application in constructing minimum spanning trees (MSTs) from a graph.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to explore and compare the workings of Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms. Through a hands-on approach, this repository delves into the intricacies of these algorithms, offering visual representations, a comprehensive report, and well-commented code for educational and research purposes.
